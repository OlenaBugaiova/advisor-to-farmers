# LLM for Norwegian Agriculture
Large Language Models succeeded across domains while are still underexplored in agriculture. At the same time, the greatest progress has been made in English, leaving other languages with limited resources behind. The aim of this project is to distill LLM to the domain of Norwegian agriculture within the Norwegian language focusing on question aswering task, see [presentation](https://github.com/OlenaBugaiova/advisor-to-farmers/blob/main/documentation/presentation/AI%20chat%20about%20agriculture.pdf).

 Previously, at Norsøk, we collected [text data](https://github.com/OlenaBugaiova/collecting-data-about-norwegian-agriculture) about Norwegian agriculture and described motivation for the project, methods and the dataset in a [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340925000587). As a part of this project, I generated the first version of a [synthetic evaluation dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/norjordAI/nor_agriculture_bench) consisting of question/answer pairs to guide in the implementation of RAG. The dataset needs further validation and might be updated.
