# LLM for Norwegian Agriculture
Large Language Models succeeded across domains while not yet being explored enough in agriculture. I want to adapt LLM to the domain of Norwegian Agriculture within the Norwegian language, [see presentation](https://github.com/OlenaBugaiova/advisor-to-farmers/blob/main/documentation/presentation/AI%20chat%20about%20agriculture.pdf). 

Previously, I collected [text data](https://github.com/OlenaBugaiova/collecting-data-about-norwegian-agriculture) about Norwegian agriculture and described the process, results and methods in a [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340925000587).
